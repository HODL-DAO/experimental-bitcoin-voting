## Getting Started
This application has been developed using [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). 
Simply clone the Git repository, navigate to the project directory on your local machine in the terminal and run:

    npm install

Once that has completed you can then run the command:

    npm run dev
    
Navigate to *localhost:5000* in your browser and you're good to go!
